									<i>Recognition & Gratitude</i>
								</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								Lots of gratitude for all those who have been apart of my university journey (+ my bonus gap year from 2018-2019).
								<br>
								<br>
								Thank you to <strong>Dr. Tessa Farmer</strong> – your passion and intellectual love for the GSMS program and its students is unmatched and doesn't go unnoticed. Your understanding and support over the course of these past two years is so appreciated. 
								<br>
								<br>
								A special shoutout to those in the nonprofit fundraising space that have guided me. 
								Thanks to <strong>Erin Hall</strong> for my first introduction to philanthropy in spring 2021 with LPPS 3150, and being generous with conversations and advice ever since then. 
								Thanks also to <strong>Kara McClurken</strong>, President of Bennett's Village, for letting me join the team to gain hands-on leadership experience in the nonprofit philanthropy sector and be apart of making Charlottesville a more inclusive space. 
								<br>
								<br>
								Thank you to my family - especially my parents <strong>Carrie and Mike Shekleton</strong> for your support. Thank you to my grandmother <strong>Norma Conroy</strong> for letting me crash at your house for holidays and always sending me back to Charlottesville with sweets.
								Thanks to <strong>the Mohr family</strong> for visiting me in Charlottesville and all of the Costco/grocery runs my 3rd year.
								<br>
								<br>
								Last but not least, for my three little sisters <strong> Teagan, Claire, and Elaina </strong> - I love you to "bella Roma" and back. 
								As much as I'm excited for my own post-grad future, I'm even more excited to see where yours will go.
