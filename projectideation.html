									<h3>The Significance</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Money makes the world go 'round.
									Unconfined to the for-profit world, the operations of nonprofit and global humanitarian organisations are bound by the generosity of charitable donations.  
									With the majority of surplus wealth mostly concentrated in the Global North, this creates an echo chamber for the advancement of Global North-led humanitarian priorities. 
									<br>
									<br>
									And so here lies the ultimate dilemma facing the global philanthropy ecosystem: it is a paradox of altruism that supports a hierarchy of humanity. 
									<br>

									<h3>My "Why"</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									"Power Dynamics of Global Philanthropy" is a response to my interest in exploring the inequities present in the global philanthropy ecosystem from a quantitative perspective. 
									I believe that philanthropy, at its best and most transformative form, creates positive outcomes in global humanitarian crises response.
									But something that I wonder is, how can philanthropy be mobilised to better align with community-identified needs? 
									Rather than reinvent the wheel, this is when I turned to focus my attention on studying a popular yet underdeveloped channel for charitable giving: the online crowdfunding platform. 
									<br>
									<br>
									Selection of this particular case study, the role of philanthropy in the Afghan and Ukrainian Migration Crises, is inspired by some of my personal experiences. 
									From a summer job processing visas at the US Embassy in Rome, I gained a bit of insight into the bureaucratic complexities of global human movement particularly in relation to the MENA region. 
									My Ukrainian heritage (albeit 4+ generations ago, so it's not too strong a connection) has led me to be attentive the situation of Ukraine.
									A daily reader of the morning news, the current events related to the Afghan and Ukraine Migration Crises have been a recurrent presence over the past two years in my newsfeed, and so a comparative study of both was a natural choice for me.
									There has been a noticeable difference (at least to me) in the outpouring of support and solidarity by the international community towards Ukraine. 
									I was curious to pursue this story from the lens of philanthropy, due to my 2+ years of experience in the sector through internships and volunteer work.

									<h3>Design Considerations</h3>
								</header>
								<h4><i>Global South- Oriented Perspective</i></h4>
								<p>
									First off, I want to acknowledge the situation in both Afghanistan and Ukraine, and emphasise that my heart goes out equally towards those affected by violence, forced migration, and all other conseqeuences that go hand-in-hand with a humanitarian crisis situation. 
									My project is not intended to elevate a particular cause over the other, or pass judgement about donor motivations for charitable giving. 
									Rather, this is an exploratory project to meld my interests in Global South perspective, migration, philanthropy, and data science, with the hopes of producing knowledge to better the academic field of philanthropy.
									In the spirit of the Global Studies: Middle East/South Asia program, my project "attempts something of an inversion of the traditional dichotomy of EuroAmerica as the locus of knowledge production, and areas such as the ME and SA as the locations of “raw data.” 
									As Jean and John Comaroff ask, 'What if…in the present moment, it is the global south that affords privileged insight into the workings of the world at large?' (2012). "

								</p>
								<h4><i>Inclusive Design</i></h4>
								<p>
									In hopes of making quanitiative information more accessibile to the general public, the main delivery vehicle for my research findings is data visualisation.
									Also, design choices surrounding data visualisation and this website seeks to be inclusive from the accesibility lens: the color palatte used is ADA-accessible as consulted by the <a href="https://abc.useallfive.com/" <i>Use All Five website</i> </a> and color-blind friendly as per the <a href="" <i>Coloring for Colorblindness website by David Nichols.</i></a>
